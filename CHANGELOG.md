## 0.5

Added multisig support in Transaction. Factory methods now accept PublicKeyAccount for `sender` rather than PrivateKeyAccount, and a separate `signers` array. This is a source-compatible change, however, existing code may need to be recompiled.

Also replaced `signature` with `proofs`, and added methods to add proofs to a transaction.
